# Ideas

1. Snack overflow pseudo-vending machine using electronic locks and raspberry pi whereopening anything even on shelves takes a code linked to square payment

2. CLI or app that only says No. and tracks days where you havent done anything on a list of habits / behaviors

3. Instagram template exporter so when browsing instagram on the web, you have a button that automatically records the video, saves the music from the template, and throws it in your saved templates

4. app only for ideas like this

5. A programming language that treats Minecraft redstone like circuit designâ€”kids write code to define farm logic and automation systems, then the compiler generates the actual block layouts and wiring

6. journalling app or CLI tool that focuses on giving your future self instructions for what to do better the next time you live this day. Stuff like dont each mcDonalds next time, dont get on instagram reels, and then we can analyze what were regretting a lot. 


7. meal prep business on campus where the meals are delivered to a locked fridge and you can pick it up

8. cat business where you sell those goofy ah cat bowls that I saw on reels, contact instagram accounts and give them 20% of the revenue for a quality product

9. book tracking github cli tool

10. get AI gen cat meme account up and running to test the entire AI gen workflow

11. the app youre never supposed to use: an app where you start with a github like view of the rest of the year being perfect where you havent done any of the bad habits you want to break. going on the website/app you only can log that youve done it. 


12. completley private journalling CLI app that also can connect to a basic web frontend through docker or localhost3000

13. run every day with another mile added each day
